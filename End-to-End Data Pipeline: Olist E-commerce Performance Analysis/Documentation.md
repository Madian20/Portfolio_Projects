# Brazilian E-commerce Analytics – Showcase Project


## Overview

This repository is a **showcase data analytics project** based on a public Brazilian e-commerce dataset that captures the end-to-end lifecycle of online orders, including purchases, payments, deliveries, and customer reviews.

Brazilian e-commerce is one of the largest and fastest-growing online retail markets in Latin America, characterized by a broad customer base, diverse product categories, and complex logistics across regions.

The dataset includes detailed information about customers, orders, products, sellers, payment methods, delivery timelines, and review scores, offering a realistic representation of large-scale e-commerce operations.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical skills in SQL analysis, Python-based exploratory data analysis, and business-focused dashboarding using Power BI.

It follows a structured analytical approach, starting with targeted SQL questions, followed by deeper exploration in Python, and concluding with an interactive dashboard.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

* Showcase analytical thinking rather than complex pipelines
* Demonstrate clarity in answering business questions
* Highlight Python exploration and visualization skills
* Present insights in a professional BI dashboard format

This project is intended for portfolio presentation to recruiters and hiring managers.

## Phase 1: SQL 

**Goal:** Answer a limited set of clearly defined business questions using SQL.

### Tools Used

* SQL Server

### Scope

The SQL phase consists of **four analytical questions**.
To support these questions, a basic **ETL process** was performed to extract the required data, transform it through joins and aggregations, and prepare it for analysis.

Each question is designed to reflect common business requests asked of a data analyst.


The SQL work focuses on:

* Combining multiple tables using appropriate joins
* Aggregating order and revenue data
* Filtering and grouping to produce concise result sets
* Writing clean, readable queries suitable for review

## Phase 2: Python Exploratory and Analytical Analysis

**Goal:** Perform extensive exploration and visualization that goes beyond SQL capabilities.

### Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Ploty
* Altair
* Itables
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

### Detailed Description

This phase represents the **deepest analytical layer** of the project.

The Python notebook includes:

* Data loading and structured preparation for analysis
* Handling missing values and correcting data types
* Feature creation such as delivery duration, order timelines, and aggregated measures
* Time-series analysis of revenue and orders
* Category-level analysis with multiple breakdowns
* Payment method analysis and comparison
* Delivery performance analysis relative to order lifecycle
* Customer review and rating analysis
* Multiple visualizations to support each analytical section

The notebook contains **numerous charts and tables**, each aligned with a specific analytical question.
The analysis is written in a step-by-step narrative format to reflect structured analytical thinking rather than isolated code snippets.

## Phase 3: Power BI Dashboarding

**Goal:** Build a clear and interactive dashboard for business users.

### Tools Used

* Power BI Desktop
* DAX

### Dashboard Description

The Power BI dashboard is built directly from the analytical dataset and focuses on clarity, usability, and storytelling.

The dashboard includes:

* High-level KPI cards (Revenue, Orders, Ratings, Delivery Performance)
* Revenue trends over time
* Top product categories by revenue
* Payment method distribution
* Geographic distribution of orders across Brazil
* Interactive slicers for time and category filtering

Design choices prioritize readability and logical layout, making the dashboard suitable for executive review.
